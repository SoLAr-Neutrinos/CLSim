# CLSim
Parametrized charge and light simulation

## Install 

1. Make sure root6 is installed and active 
2. Run `make` 

## Input Files 

Use [qpixg4](https://github.com/Q-Pix/qpixg4) for the G4 generation.  (We should probably fork that at some point to have something like this - Talk to Johnny about this!)

## Run 

`./analyze_light InputOfG4 PlacementForPD PDSize OutputFile (--charge PlacementForCD --pixSize CDSize --number NEvents)`
